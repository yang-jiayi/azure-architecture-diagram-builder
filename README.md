## 📖 Overview

Azure Architecture Diagram Builder is an enterprise-grade web application that empowers cloud architects to design, visualize, validate, and deploy Azure solutions. Leveraging **12 AI models** across multiple providers — **GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, GPT-5.2 Codex, GPT-5.3 Codex, GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4 Mini, DeepSeek V3.2 Speciale, DeepSeek V4 Pro, Grok 4.1 Fast, Grok 4.3, Mistral Large 3, and Kimi K2.5** (via Azure OpenAI and Azure AI model deployments) — it transforms natural language descriptions into professional architecture diagrams while providing real-time cost estimates, Well-Architected Framework validation, multi-model comparison, and Infrastructure as Code generation.

Beyond editable **topology** diagrams, the app can also produce polished, whiteboard-style **Blueprint** diagrams (BETA) as shareable PNGs — ideal for presentations and design reviews.

### Why This Tool?

- **Speed**: Go from idea to deployable architecture in minutes, not hours
- **Accuracy**: Official Azure icons, real-time pricing from Azure Retail Prices API
- **Best Practices**: Built-in WAF validation ensures your architecture follows Microsoft recommendations
- **Actionable Output**: Generate deployment guides with Bicep/ARM templates ready for production

### 🎯 Scope & Intended Use

This tool is designed for **greenfield Azure** architecture design — sketching, validating, and
costing **new** solutions, and as an accelerator in architecture-design sessions and technical
workshops. It supports **Azure services only**.

The WAF validation produces a **diagram-only, design-time signal** intended to guide new designs.
It is **not** an audit of a deployed environment, and it is **not** intended for direct deployment
into existing, complex customer environments without further validation and review by a qualified
architect.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Architecture Generation
Describe your architecture in plain English and let any of **12 AI models** (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, GPT-5.2 Codex, GPT-5.3 Codex, GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4 Mini, DeepSeek V3.2 Speciale, DeepSeek V4 Pro, Grok 4.1 Fast, Grok 4.3, Mistral Large 3, or Kimi K2.5) automatically create a complete, professionally organized diagram with logical service groupings.

**13 curated example prompts** included — from simple web apps to complex enterprise scenarios:
- Zero Trust enterprise networks with security segmentation
- Healthcare HIPAA-compliant platforms with FHIR APIs
- Black Friday e-commerce handling 50K orders/hour
- Industrial IoT with 5,000+ sensors and predictive maintenance
- Global multiplayer gaming backends for 500K+ concurrent players
- AI-powered chatbots, document processing, content moderation
- And more...

### 🖼️ Architecture Image Import
Upload an existing architecture diagram image (screenshot, whiteboard photo, or exported PNG) and let AI analyze it to recreate the architecture as an editable, interactive diagram with proper Azure service mapping.

### 💬 Architecture Chat (Conversational Refinement)
Refine your diagram through a natural back-and-forth conversation instead of one-shot prompts. Click the **Chat** button in the toolbar to open a docked side panel where you can iterate in plain English:

- Type changes like *"add Azure Front Door with WAF"* → *"now make it zone-redundant"* → *"add a Redis cache between the API and the database"*
- Each turn reads the **live canvas** as the source of truth, so follow-up requests naturally build on previous ones
- The assistant replies with a concise summary of what changed (services added/removed)
- Every change is **auto-saved to version history**, so you can step back at any time
- Suggestion chips help you get started, and the panel shows which model is active

### ✏️ Blueprint Diagrams (BETA)
Generate a hand-drawn, **whiteboard-style blueprint** of your architecture — nested zones (Azure / VNet / On-prem) with numbered, labeled arrows that trace the end-to-end flow, just like an architect explaining a system at a whiteboard. Three generation modes are available in the AI Generator modal:

- **Topology** — the classic deployable, editable diagram on the canvas
- **Blueprint** *(BETA)* — a polished whiteboard-style PNG (the PNG is the deliverable; re-download any time via **Export > Export Blueprint PNG**)
- **Both** *(BETA)* — a deployable topology **and** a Blueprint PNG from the same prompt, optionally generated in parallel

> Blueprint and Both modes require a general-purpose OpenAI model (GPT-5.x). The app auto-switches if a third-party model is selected. A configurable legend position keeps the output presentation-ready.

### 📋 ARM Template Import
Import existing ARM templates and automatically visualize your current infrastructure. The AI parses resource dependencies and creates meaningful diagrams. A **glowing purple banner** provides visual feedback during parsing.

### 🎯 Well-Architected Framework Validation
Validate your architecture against all five WAF pillars:
- **Security** — Identity, encryption, network isolation
- **Reliability** — High availability, disaster recovery
- **Performance** — Scaling, caching, optimization
- **Cost Optimization** — Right-sizing, reserved instances
- **Operational Excellence** — Monitoring, automation

Select specific recommendations and automatically regenerate an improved architecture. During analysis, a dismiss hint lets you close the panel and return later via the **Validation Score** button in the toolbar.

### 🔀 Multi-Model Comparison
Compare AI output side-by-side across all 12 models:

- **Architecture Comparison** — Run the same prompt through multiple models and compare service counts, connection counts, groups, workflow steps, token usage, and latency
- **Validation Comparison** — Run WAF validation across models and compare overall scores, pillar-level scores, severity breakdowns, finding counts, and quick wins. An inline WAF info box explains the five pillars being assessed
- **Save All Diagrams** — Download each model's architecture as a separate JSON file
- **Save Comparison Report** — Download a combined JSON report for offline analysis
- **Present Critique** — Click "Present" to have a talking avatar narrate the AI ranking with live word-by-word closed captions (requires `VITE_SPEECH_REGION`)
- **Apply Winner** — Pick the best result and apply it to the canvas with one click

### 🎙️ Avatar Presenter
After completing a model comparison, use **Present Critique** to have a photorealistic talking avatar narrate the AI ranking results aloud — or click **Narrate** in the Workflow Panel to have the avatar walk through every architecture step:
- A 3D avatar appears in a **draggable, resizable** floating panel — grab the header to reposition anywhere on screen, drag the bottom-right corner to resize

### 🖼️ Draggable Reference Image Viewer
When a sketch or image is uploaded for AI generation, the reference image stays visible as a floating panel:
- **Drag** by the header bar to reposition anywhere on the canvas
- **Resize** by dragging the purple corner handle — scales from 160 × 110 px up to 700 × 700 px
- **Expand** to full-screen overlay for detail
- **Collapse** to a small pill to stay out of the way
- Live **word-by-word closed captions** highlight each spoken word in real time, synchronized via the Speech SDK `wordBoundary` event
- **Keyless authentication** — no API keys stored; a lightweight Express.js token server runs co-located with nginx inside the container, acquiring an AAD token via `DefaultAzureCredential` (Azure Managed Identity) and returning it as `aad#{resourceId}#{aadToken}` on each request
- The "Present" / "Narrate" buttons are only visible when `VITE_SPEECH_REGION` is configured at image build time; no UI impact when not set

### 🗂️ Collapse All Groups
Toggle button to collapse or expand all groups at once for a bird's-eye view of the architecture. Restores original group sizes on expand.

### 🔄 Workflow Animation & Data Flow
Visualize how data flows through your architecture step-by-step:
- Interactive step-by-step walkthrough of the architecture
- Service highlighting — each step highlights the involved services on the canvas
- Animated connections showing data flow direction
- AI-generated descriptions for each workflow step
- **Narrate** button (when Speech is configured) — avatar speaks all steps aloud with live closed captions in a draggable, resizable panel

### 📄 Deployment Guide Generation with Bicep
Generate comprehensive deployment documentation including:
- Prerequisites and Azure resource requirements
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- **Bicep templates** for each service (Infrastructure as Code)
- Post-deployment verification steps
- Security configuration recommendations
- **Grounded in Microsoft Learn** — before generating, the app searches official Microsoft Learn documentation for your services (via a server-side proxy to the Microsoft Learn MCP endpoint) and feeds the results into the model so commands, API versions, and Bicep schemas reflect current docs. A **“Grounded with Microsoft Learn”** references section lists the cited pages, which are also included in the exported Markdown. Grounding is best-effort: if docs are unavailable the guide still generates.

### 💰 Real-Time Multi-Region Cost Estimation
Get instant cost estimates across **8 Azure regions**:
- 🇺🇸 East US 2 · 🇦🇺 Australia East · 🇨🇦 Canada Central · 🇧🇷 Brazil South · 🇲🇽 Mexico Central · 🇳🇱 West Europe · 🇸🇪 Sweden Central · 🇸🇬 Southeast Asia

  - `-summary.md` — Markdown summary with tables for by-service, by-group, and by-category costs
  - `-analysis.md` — intelligent Markdown report: TL;DR callout, top cost drivers, a **Mermaid pie chart** of cost by category, fixed vs usage-based split, Reserved Instance flags, and a **ranked multi-region comparison table** showing cheapest/most expensive region and potential savings
  - `.csv` — spreadsheet for Excel
  - `.json` — structured breakdown for programmatic use
  - `-multiregion-comparison.csv` — per-service pricing across all 8 regions for side-by-side comparison

### 🧠 Smart Layout Engine

## ⚡ One-command deploy with Azure Developer CLI (azd)

The fastest way to provision all Azure resources and deploy the app is with [`azd`](https://aka.ms/azd):

```bash
# 1. Install azd (once)
winget install microsoft.azd   # Windows
brew tap azure/azd && brew install azd   # macOS

# 2. Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/Arturo-Quiroga-MSFT/azure-architecture-diagram-builder
cd azure-architecture-diagram-builder

# 3. Log in
azd auth login

# 4. Set your Azure OpenAI details (bring-your-own resource)
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT       "https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/"
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY        "your-key"
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME "gpt-5.1"         # adjust to your deployments
azd env set AZURE_SPEECH_REGION        "westus2"

# 5. Provision infrastructure + build + deploy  (≈ 8 min first run)
azd up
```

`azd up` provisions (via Bicep in `infra/`):

| Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Azure Container Registry | Stores the Docker image |
| Azure Container Apps | Runs the app (nginx + token server) |
| Log Analytics + App Insights | Monitoring and telemetry |
| Azure Speech (S0) | Avatar Presenter feature (keyless auth via managed identity) |
| Cosmos DB *(optional)* | Diagram persistence — set `deployCosmos=true` in `infra/main.parameters.json` |

After `azd up` completes, the app URL is printed and captured in `SERVICE_APP_URL`.

> **Keyless Azure OpenAI (optional).** `azd up` passes your OpenAI key to the
> container as a runtime value used by the `/api/openai` proxy, so it works out
> of the box. To drop the key entirely, grant the app's managed identity the
> **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role on your Azure OpenAI resource and clear
> `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` from the Container App. (The Bicep already assigns the
> *Cognitive Services Speech User* and *Cosmos DB Data Contributor* roles, but
> not OpenAI, because the OpenAI resource is bring-your-own / external.)

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

[`.github/workflows/azure-dev.yml`](.github/workflows/azure-dev.yml) re-deploys on every push to `main`.
Required GitHub secrets/variables:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Service principal / federated credential client ID |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Entra ID tenant ID |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Subscription ID |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI endpoint |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | Azure OpenAI API key |

Set `AZURE_ENV_NAME` and `AZURE_LOCATION` as **variables** (not secrets).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (LTS recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Azure OpenAI** resource with GPT model deployment

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/azure-diagrams.git
cd azure-diagrams
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Azure OpenAI Configuration (Required)
#
# SECURITY: Azure OpenAI calls are proxied server-side by the co-located token
# server (server/token-server.js) via the /api/openai endpoint. The API key is
# NEVER shipped to the browser. Keyless auth (managed identity / `az login`) is
# preferred; a key is only used as a fallback when AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY is set.
#
# VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT is a non-secret build-time flag that signals the
# UI that AI is configured. In dev, scripts/start-token-server.sh bridges the
# VITE_ values to the server-side names (AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT / _API_KEY).
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here   # optional fallback; bridged to the server only, never bundled
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=your-default-deployment

# Multi-model deployments (12 models)
# OpenAI GPT-5.x family
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_GPT51=your-gpt51-deployment
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_GPT52=your-gpt52-deployment

# Optional: Cloud storage for sharing
AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT=https://your-cosmos.documents.azure.com:443/
COSMOS_DATABASE_ID=diagrams
COSMOS_CONTAINER_ID=diagrams

# Optional: Application Insights telemetry
# Create an App Insights resource in Azure Portal and paste the connection string
VITE_APPINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=InstrumentationKey=...;IngestionEndpoint=...

# Optional: Avatar Presenter (enables "Present Critique" button in Compare Models)
# Requires an Azure Speech resource with Custom Subdomain enabled and
# the ACA managed identity assigned the "Cognitive Services Speech User" RBAC role
VITE_SPEECH_REGION=westus2                 # Build-time: controls visibility of the "Present" button
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=westus2               # Runtime: read by the co-located token server
AZURE_SPEECH_RESOURCE_ID=/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<speech-account-name>
```

4. **Start the development server**
```bash
# Standard (no avatar)
npm run dev

# With avatar presenter: starts token server + Vite concurrently
npm run dev:avatar

# Recommended for end-to-end local testing before pushing to GitHub.
# Loads .env, verifies required AZURE_SPEECH_* vars, checks `az login`
# (warns if not on the expected subscription), confirms ports 3000/3001
# are free, installs deps if missing, starts the speech token server,
# probes `/api/speech-token`, then runs Vite in the foreground.
# Single Ctrl-C cleans up all child processes. Logs land in `.dev-logs/`.
./scripts/dev-all.sh                # token server + Vite
./scripts/dev-all.sh --with-mcp     # also build & start the MCP server
./scripts/dev-all.sh --skip-az-check  # skip the Azure CLI verification
```

#### Avatar narrator troubleshooting

If the avatar panel opens but the video stays blank (audio may also fail), open DevTools and look for `[avatar] ICE state: failed`. That means the WebRTC peer connection cannot reach `relay.communication.microsoft.com:3478` (UDP) — common on corporate networks, VPNs, and some home ISPs.

The app already mitigates this: it offers both the UDP candidate and a TCP/443 fallback (`turn:relay.communication.microsoft.com:443?transport=tcp`) and forces `iceTransportPolicy: 'relay'`. If you still see ICE failures, your network is also blocking outbound 443 to that host — escalate to your network team or test from a different network.

To experiment with the legacy UDP-only path, run this in the browser console **before** clicking Narrate:

```js

### Docker Deployment (Local)

```bash
# Build the image. Vite vars are build args (deployment NAMES and the endpoint
# are non-secret). The Azure OpenAI API key is intentionally NOT a build arg —
# it is supplied at RUNTIME to the token server (AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT and,
# optionally, AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY) and proxied via /api/openai. Prefer managed
# identity (Cognitive Services OpenAI User role) and leave the key unset.
docker build -t azure-diagram-builder \
  --build-arg VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="..." \
  --build-arg VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_GPT51="..." \
  --build-arg VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_GPT52="..." \

## 🌟 What's New

### June 2026 — Blueprint Diagrams (BETA) & 12-Model Lineup

#### ✏️ Blueprint Diagrams (BETA)
The AI Generator modal now offers three **diagram modes**:
- **Topology** — the classic deployable, editable canvas diagram
- **Blueprint** *(BETA)* — a hand-drawn, whiteboard-style PNG with nested zones (Azure / VNet / On-prem) and numbered, labeled arrows tracing the end-to-end flow
- **Both** *(BETA)* — generate a deployable topology **and** a Blueprint PNG from the same prompt (optionally in parallel)

Blueprint output is delivered as a polished PNG (the PNG is the deliverable, not a canvas render) and can be re-downloaded anytime via **Export › Export Blueprint PNG**. A configurable legend position keeps results presentation-ready. Blueprint/Both modes require a general-purpose OpenAI model (GPT-5.x); the app auto-switches if a partner model is selected.

#### 🤖 Expanded to 12 AI Models
The model lineup grew from 7 to **12**, adding **GPT-5.4 Mini**, **DeepSeek V4 Pro**, **Grok 4.3**, **Mistral Large 3**, and **Kimi K2.5** alongside the existing GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, GPT-5.2 Codex, GPT-5.3 Codex, GPT-5.4, DeepSeek V3.2 Speciale, and Grok 4.1 Fast. Every feature (generation, validation, comparison) can be assigned its own model.

#### 📤 New Export Formats
- **Interactive HTML** — self-contained page with pan, zoom, and tooltips
- **Blueprint PNG** — re-export the whiteboard-style blueprint

---

### March 14, 2026 — Workflow Avatar Narrator & Draggable/Resizable Panels

#### 🎙️ Narrate Workflow (new)
The Workflow Panel (right side of canvas) now has a **Narrate** button in its header. Click it to have a talking avatar speak every architecture step aloud:
- Narration text is built from the existing workflow steps — `"Step 1: … Step 2: … "` — no extra AI call
- Same avatar session, closed-caption, and token-server infrastructure as the Compare Models presenter
- Button is only rendered when `VITE_SPEECH_REGION` is set

#### 🖱️ Draggable & Resizable Avatar Panels
Both avatar panels (Workflow Narrator and Compare Models Presenter) are now fully interactive:
- **Drag** the panel header to reposition anywhere on the viewport
- **Resize** by dragging the diagonal-stripe handle in the bottom-right corner
- Position and size are clamped to the viewport so the panel can never be dragged off-screen
- Panel resets to its default position/size when dismissed

#### 🔧 Infrastructure
- `src/hooks/useDraggableResizable.ts` — new shared hook using pointer capture (`el.setPointerCapture`) for smooth, lag-free drag and resize; React `currentTarget` captured into locals before closures to avoid the synthetic-event nullification bug
- `pointercancel` listener added to both drag and resize handlers for clean-up on focus-loss or touch cancel

---

### March 13, 2026 — Talking Avatar Presenter

#### 🎙️ Present Critique (new)
Compare AI model critiques, then click **"Present"** to have a photorealistic **talking avatar** narrate the ranked results aloud, right in the browser:

- **Floating avatar panel** — 3D avatar appears at bottom-right inside the Compare Models modal while speaking
- **Word-by-word closed captions** — each word highlights in real time as the avatar speaks, driven by the Speech SDK `wordBoundary` event
- **Keyless authentication** — no API keys stored: `server/token-server.js` (Express.js, port 3001) runs co-located with nginx. On each `/api/speech-token` request it acquires an AAD token via `DefaultAzureCredential` and returns `aad#{resourceId}#{aadToken}` directly to the Speech SDK
- **ICE relay** — `/api/ice-token` endpoint fetches WebRTC relay credentials from Azure so avatar video works through corporate firewalls
- **Build-time feature flag** — the "Present" button is only rendered when `VITE_SPEECH_REGION` is set at image build time

#### 🔒 Server-side AI proxy
The same token server also brokers Azure OpenAI so credentials never reach the browser:

- **`/api/openai`** — proxies architecture generation, chat refinement, validation, and deployment-guide calls to Azure OpenAI. Prefers managed identity (`DefaultAzureCredential`) and falls back to `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` when set. Requires `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` at runtime. The client only sends the request body, deployment name, and API format — the key is never bundled.
- **`/api/docs-search`** — grounds deployment guides in official Microsoft Learn documentation by calling the Microsoft Learn MCP endpoint server-side and returning citable `{title, url, excerpt}` results. Best-effort (soft-fails to empty).

#### 🔧 Infrastructure
- `server/token-server.js` — new Express.js token server started by `start.sh` before nginx
- `src/services/avatarPresenter.ts` — Speech SDK avatar session, ICE relay, word-boundary callback
- `Dockerfile` — extended build stage with `ARG/ENV VITE_SPEECH_REGION`; production stage installs token server deps
- `scripts/update_aca.sh` — adds `VITE_SPEECH_REGION` build arg and `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION` / `AZURE_SPEECH_RESOURCE_ID` runtime env vars
- ACA managed identity assigned `Cognitive Services Speech User` role on the Speech resource (no stored credentials)

### March 12, 2026 — PPTX Export & SVG Edge Rendering Fix

#### 🖼️ Export Diagram as PowerPoint Slide (new)
- **"Export PPTX Slide"** added to the Export dropdown menu
- Generates a single widescreen 16:9 `.pptx` file via **PptxGenJS** — entirely client-side, no backend required
- Slide theme automatically mirrors the current canvas mode:
  - **Dark mode** → slate-900 background, white title, Azure-blue accent bars
  - **Light mode** → slate-50 background, dark title, same accent
- Slide includes: diagram name, author, date (from the Architecture Diagram title block), the diagram image (aspect-ratio preserved), and a footer
- Export is recorded in the Recent Exports history like all other formats

#### 🔧 SVG Edge Rendering Fix — all exports (PNG, SVG, PPTX, validation snapshots)

**The problem:** ReactFlow edges (smooth, bezier, orthogonal, dashed) were invisible in all exported images.

**Root cause:** ReactFlow draws edges as SVG `<path>` elements whose `stroke` colour comes solely from the `reactflow/dist/style.css` stylesheet via the `.react-flow__edge-path` CSS class. The previous `html2canvas` library dropped SVG content almost entirely. After switching to `html-to-image`, the DOM is serialised correctly — but inside the resulting SVG `<foreignObject>`, the page's external stylesheets are no longer in scope, so every path renders with no stroke (invisible).

**Fix — `src/utils/captureCanvas.ts`:**
1. `html2canvas` replaced with `html-to-image` across all four capture call sites (PNG export, SVG export, PPTX export, validation snapshot)
2. A new `prepareEdgesForCapture()` helper runs synchronously before every capture. It iterates every `svg path/line/polyline/circle` inside the ReactFlow wrapper, reads each element's **computed CSS** via `window.getComputedStyle()`, and writes the results back as **SVG presentation attributes** (`stroke`, `stroke-width`, `stroke-dasharray`, `fill`, `opacity`, `marker-end`, etc.) directly on the element. Presentation attributes survive serialisation regardless of whether stylesheets are present
3. After capture completes (or throws), all attributes are restored to their original values so the live canvas is unaffected
4. Transparent fills are normalised to `none` (SVG convention) to avoid invisible filled areas

All edge types now render correctly: solid sync edges, dashed async edges, dotted optional edges, animated directional-flow edges, and bidirectional pulse edges.
